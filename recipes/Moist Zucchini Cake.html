    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>This zucchini cake is my son’s favorite — it stays very moist and also freezes well. I usually frost it with cream cheese frosting, but it’s also great plain.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        2 cups all-purpose flour

        3 teaspoons ground cinnamon
        
        2 teaspoons baking soda
        
        1 teaspoon salt
        
        ¼ teaspoon baking powder
        
        2 cups grated zucchini
        
        1 ½ cups white sugar
        
        1 cup vegetable oil
        
        3 large eggs, lightly beaten
        
        2 teaspoons vanilla extract
        
        1 cup chopped walnuts
    </ul>
    <h3>Directions</h3>
    <li>1. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Lightly grease a 9x13-inch baking dish.</li>
    <li>2. Combine flour, cinnamon, baking soda, salt, and baking powder in a bowl. Mix zucchini, sugar, vegetable oil, eggs, and vanilla in a separate bowl. Add flour mixture to zucchini mixture and stir until just combined. Stir in walnuts, then pour batter into the prepared pan.</li>
    <li>3. Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean, about 45 minutes.</li>
