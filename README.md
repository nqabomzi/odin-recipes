# Odin Recipes

## Introduction

Welcome to the Odin Recipes project! This project is part of my journey in learning cross-platform app development. The goal of this project is to create a simple recipe website using HTML and CSS.

## Skills Demonstrated

By completing this project, I will have demonstrated the following skills:

- **HTML Basics**: Understanding the structure of HTML documents, using various HTML tags, and creating links and lists.
- **Git and GitHub**: Cloning repositories, committing changes, and pushing updates to a remote repository.

This README file will be updated as the project progresses and serves as a reflection on what I have learned.

Stay tuned for more updates!
